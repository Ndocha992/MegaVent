## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have:
- Flutter 3.13+ installed
- Firebase CLI configured
- Git configured with your details
- Code editor with Flutter/Dart extensions

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/megavent.git
   cd megavent
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/megavent.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
5. Set up Firebase (see INSTRUCTIONS.md)

## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

We use a feature branch workflow:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Push to your fork
4. Create a Pull Request

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Test improvements

Examples:
- `feature/qr-scanner-enhancement`
- `fix/authentication-bug`
- `docs/api-documentation`

## Code Standards

### Dart/Flutter Guidelines

Follow the official [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and [Flutter Style Guide](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Style-guide-for-Flutter-repo).

### Code Formatting

- Use `dart format` before committing
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Keep line length under 80 characters where possible
- Use meaningful variable and function names

### Code Organization

```dart
// Good
class EventService {
  final FirebaseFirestore _firestore;
  final FirebaseAuth _auth;

  EventService({
    required FirebaseFirestore firestore,
    required FirebaseAuth auth,
  }) : _firestore = firestore, _auth = auth;

  Future<List<Event>> fetchEvents() async {
    // Implementation
  }
}

// Avoid
class ES {
  var f;
  var a;
  // Poor naming and structure
}
```

### Widget Structure

- Keep widget trees shallow (< 3 levels deep)
- Extract complex widgets into separate classes
- Use const constructors where possible
- Prefer composition over inheritance

```dart
// Good
class EventCard extends StatelessWidget {
  const EventCard({
    Key? key,
    required this.event,
    this.onTap,
  }) : super(key: key);

  final Event event;
  final VoidCallback? onTap;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Card(
      child: ListTile(
        title: Text(event.title),
        subtitle: Text(event.description),
        onTap: onTap,
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Documentation Standards

- Add dartdoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex business logic
- Include examples for utility functions
- Keep comments concise and relevant

```dart
/// Generates a secure QR code hash for event registration.
/// 
/// Combines [eventId], [userId], and [timestamp] to create a unique
/// SHA-256 hash that serves as the QR code data.
/// 
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// final hash = QrService.generateRegistrationHash(
///   eventId: 'event123',
///   userId: 'user456',
///   timestamp: DateTime.now(),
/// );
/// ```
static String generateRegistrationHash({
  required String eventId,
  required String userId,
  required DateTime timestamp,
}) {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% test coverage for new features
- Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
- Test both happy path and edge cases

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual functions and classes
2. **Widget Tests** - Test UI components
3. **Integration Tests** - Test complete user flows

### Test Structure

```dart
void main() {
  group('QrService', () {
    test('generateRegistrationHash creates unique hash', () {
      // Arrange
      const eventId = 'test-event';
      const userId = 'test-user';
      final timestamp = DateTime.now();

      // Act
      final hash = QrService.generateRegistrationHash(
        eventId: eventId,
        userId: userId,
        timestamp: timestamp,
      );

      // Assert
      expect(hash, isNotEmpty);
      expect(hash.length, equals(64)); // SHA-256 hash length
    });
  });
}
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/services/qr_service_test.dart
```

## Submitting Changes

### Commit Message Format
